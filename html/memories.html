        <h2>The First Chat</h2>
        <h4>2nd November 2022</h4>
        <p>I so much remember the first chat that we did and that day we chatted around 3 a.m in the night.
        At that time I never thought this is a chat that would last now three years to be honest.
        That would have been the first and the last beautiful chat of my life.</p>

        <h2>The First Love You</h2>
        <h4>3rd December 2022</h4>
        <p>That was simply one of the greatest things of my life. The first time when such a soulful person said 3 beautiful, soulful words, my heart was beating fast. 
        It was again around 4-5 am in the morning. I remember my body was warm and I enjoyed every bit of that feeling.</p>

        <h4>1st April 2023</h4>
        <p>What a beautiful gift she gave on my 1st birthday. Well, there were 2 gifts. 
        One was a beautiful, beautiful note that she made just innocently like a small child. 
        And other was such a beautiful mashup of 3 different songs in 3 different languages of 3 different genres. 
        That was the best gift of my birthday.</p>

        <h2>The First Video Call</h2>
        <h4>30th June 2023</h4>
        <p>I so much remember her first video call. We both were a little bit shy because it was our first video call but as well as so much excited from the inside. 
        And then the beautiful face came in front of my eyes through the small screen of my phone. 
        Though the screen was small the beauty was immensely large. She had a beautiful nose ring, a sweet red t-shirt and open hairs and damn she was looking the most beautiful that day.</p>

        <p>This was the birthday for which I was excited most in my life. It was her first birthday and I was excited to gift her as much as things that I can. 
        I sent her a 30-minute video which described her entire life in a song as well as some beautiful donations that I believe we both contributed. 
        And again a beautiful video message for her. I enjoyed doing every bit of her gifts.</p>

        <p>Finally the day occurred when you completed your formal training in driving your scooty. 
        It might be a small thing , but seeing the happiness on her face made it so big I can't even tell. 
        And I thought this is such a big achievement of hers when I saw the smile on her face when she told me that she has finally completed the training of her scooty. 
        I so much loved that time when she would share me every update about her training.</p>

        <h4>24th September 2024</h4>
        <p>I've always prayed to see her in a saree and oh my god she was looking so so so pretty when she wore a saree in a Maharashtrian style 
        and she danced so beautifully on all the Lavani songs in the video call. 
        She was looking as beautiful as and as Maharashtrian as a proper Maharashtrian girl.</p>

        <h4>23rd March 2024</h4>
        <p>This is the most beautiful visit of mine to Shegaon. I have visited it before but this was the most beautiful visit. 
        I remember talking to her around 3-4 am in the night from 12 am and describing the beauty, the area, and all of the things that I did there. 
        And I felt it so great to share that with especially her. I just lost the count of time and I just kept sharing her everything that I had. 
        And I don't know but I was so happy to share with her. I felt sharing with her is the most special thing that happened that day.</p>

        <p>Something bad happened in my life and I thought I lost her permanently. Well, it was my mistake whatever happened but when I realized I might lose her permanently. Honestly I cried for a few nights. 
        Everyday I would get up and just pray God how can I go back in time so that I don't lose her at least for one more day.</p>

        <h2>The Day When I Realized We Still Have Time</h2>
        <h4>26th August 2025</h4>
        <p>The incident which happened in my life, I threw it out. I overpowered it. I overturned it. Reasons were many but I think that God gave me one more chance to be hers, to make her mine and to be with her for some more time. 
        I never regret my decision of overturning that incident because even if I get one more day with her, it is a special feeling. It is a special blessing. And for me, even one day, 24 hours count if it's with her.</p>
