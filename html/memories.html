        <h2>The First Chat</h2>
        <h4>2nd November 2022</h4>
        <p>I so much remember the first chat that we did and that day we chatted around 3 a.m in the night.
        At that time I never thought this is a chat that would last now three years to be honest.
        That would have been the first and the last beautiful chat of my life.</p>

        <h2>The First Love You</h2>
        <h4>3rd December 2022</h4>
        <p>That was simply one of the greatest things of my life. The first time when such a soulful person said 3 beautiful, soulful words, my heart was beating fast. 
        It was again around 4-5 am in the morning. I remember my body was warm and I enjoyed every bit of that feeling.</p>

        <h2>Her 1st Birthday</h2>
        <h4>1st April 2023</h4>
        <p>What a beautiful gift she gave on my 1st birthday. Well, there were 2 gifts. 
        One was a beautiful, beautiful note that she made just innocently like a small child. 
        And other was such a beautiful mashup of 3 different songs in 3 different languages of 3 different genres. 
        That was the best gift of my birthday.</p>

        <h2>The First Video Call</h2>
        <h4>30th June 2023</h4>
        <p>I so much remember her first video call. We both were a little bit shy because it was our first video call but as well as so much excited from the inside. 
        And then the beautiful face came in front of my eyes through the small screen of my phone. 
        Though the screen was small the beauty was immensely large. She had a beautiful nose ring, a sweet red t-shirt and open hairs and damn she was looking the most beautiful that day.</p>

        <p>This was the birthday for which I was excited most in my life. It was her first birthday and I was excited to gift her as much as things that I can. 
        I sent her a 30-minute video which described her entire life in a song as well as some beautiful donations that I believe we both contributed. 
        And again a beautiful video message for her. I enjoyed doing every bit of her gifts.</p>

        <h4>30th October 2023</h4>
        <p>Finally the day occurred when you completed your formal training in driving your scooty. 
        It might be a small thing for me but seeing the happiness on your face made it so big I can't even tell you. 
        And I thought this is such a big achievement of yours when I saw the smile on your face when you told me that you have finally completed the training of your scooty. 
        I so much loved that time when you would share me every update about your training.</p>

        <h4>24th September 2024</h4>
        <p>I've always prayed to see you in a saree and oh my god you were looking so so so pretty when you wore a saree in a Maharashtrian style 
        and you danced so beautifully on all the Lavani songs in the video call. 
        You were looking as beautiful as and as Maharashtrian as a proper Maharashtrian girl.</p>

        <h4>23rd March 2024</h4>
        <p>This is the most beautiful visit of mine to Shekau. I have visited it before but this was the most beautiful visit. 
        I remember talking to you around 3-4 am in the night from 12 am and describing the beauty, the area, and all of the things that I did there. 
        And I felt it so great to share that with especially you. I just lost the count of time and I just kept sharing you everything that I had. 
        And I don't know but I was so happy to share with you. I felt sharing with you is the most special thing that happened that day.</p>

        <p>Something bad happened in my life and I thought I lost you permanently. Well, it was my mistake whatever happened but when I realized I might lose you permanently, I honestly tell you I cried for a few nights. 
        Everyday I would get up and just pray God how can I go back in time so that I don't lose you at least for one more day.</p>

        <h2>The Day When I Realized We Still Have Time</h2>
        <h4>26th August 2025</h4>
        <p>The incident which happened in my life, I threw it out. I overpowered it. I overturned it. Reasons were many but I think that God gave me one more chance to be yours, to make you mine and to be with you for some more time. 
        I never regret my decision of overturning that incident because even if I get one more day with you, it is a special feeling. It is a special blessing. And for me, even one day, 24 hours count if it's with you.</p>
