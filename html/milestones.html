          Yes, she has definitely won my heart. It is really difficult to win any person‚Äôs heart over any period of time. For that, you have to be honest, pure, caring, and loving.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
          And she has definitely won all of these in these three years. She is the person who has actually won my heart in all of these three years apart from my family.

          In this not so good era of relationships, it‚Äôs so difficult to win someone‚Äôs trust and that too even in a long-distance relationship - that is impossible. But this beautiful girl has won all of my trust even being so apart away from me.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
          I trust her that she is not involved with any other person apart from me as long as I love her and I am with her. And this trust of hers gives me so much relaxation, so much of non-stressful thoughts that I don‚Äôt overthink about anything while I sleep.
        </p>
        <p class="italic text-green-600 mt-2">
          Unlike the many long-distance boyfriends that we have in this era of relationships, I thank her for this trust.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
          You know nowadays there is a lot of demand from girlfriends to get time and attention from the boyfriends. But this is not the case here. In this case, she is never someone who demands excessive time or unnecessary attention from the partner.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
          And doing so being so much understanding, she has won my time as well. You know, I have never been someone who gives much time to other people but she wins all my time.
        </p>
        <p class="italic text-purple-600 mt-2">
          Even if I am busy in something I try to get out of the situation and be with her just to give her all the time that she wants. I love spending my time with her.
